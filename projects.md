# Projects

## [PyWireframe](https://pr0x1mas.github.io/PyWireframe)

A stupid attempt at a 3D rendering engine in python's turtle graphics.

## [Quark CSS](https://pr0x1mas.github.io/quark-CSS)

A terrible CSS framework I started and gave up on.

## [EchoCMD](https://pr0x1mas.github.io/EchoCMD)

A batch script that allows you to access a simulated command prompt on any Windows PC, no matter what restrictions are in place.

## More stuff

But that's not all! You can find even more of the random and terrible things I've programmed on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Pr0x1mas), and I also have a [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/HYPERHAMSTER534/) account.
