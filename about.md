# About

## Who I am

Hi, I'm Josh, or Pr0x1mas, a kid on the internet who likes to code, play video games, and make memes.

## What I do

I learned programming with Scratch, and I mainly use Python and HTML. I've also dabbled in Visual Basic, C++, PHP,  and a weird 3D language called Alice. I have a YouTube channel which was originally going to be KSP oriented but has diverged into other games as well. I play a fair few video games, mainly on the Xbox One, a few of my favourites are Minecraft, SUPERHOT, Star Wars: Battlefront, Kerbal Space Program and Forza Horizon 4.

I am quite into freelance web development and if you want a website made then email me at joshua@the-britains.com. I do not want unsolicited offers for products or similar.
