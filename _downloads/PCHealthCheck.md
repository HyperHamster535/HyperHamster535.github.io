When Windows 11 was released, Microsoft also provided a tool known as the ['PC Health Check App'](https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp) which would provide some system information as well as inform you on whether your PC supported Windows 11. It was later removed from their site as there were complaints that it was not clear in why your device did not support Windows 11. On the Microsoft site, it states now that the tool is "coming soon". I sadly no longer have the original installer but I do have a zip file generated by it.
