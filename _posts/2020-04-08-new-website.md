Hello, world. Once again, I decided that I didn't like my current website, wrote a new one in HTML and CSS, got drawn down the Jekyll rabbit hole, and gave up on the CSS for a Jekyll theme. Unlike the previous time though, I'm not using some boring minimal theme, I'm using the most cliche console theme you've ever seen with some cringey ASCII art on the front page. Still, [could be worse](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/project-negya/). For a change, I might also use this blog system if I can think of things to write and can be bothered.
