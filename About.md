## What I do
I learned programming with Scratch, but recently I've been getting into Python and HTML. I've also dabbled in Visual Basic, C++, Javascript, and a weird 3D language called Alice. I have a YouTube channel which was originally going to be KSP oriented (and that's still my main plan) but also has gaming and coding videos. I play a fair few video games, mainly on the Xbox One, a few of my favourites are Minecraft, SUPERHOT, Kerbal Space Program and Forza Horizon 4.
